# Evolving Code
Evolving code is an experiment in progromatic art whereby we start with a simple [processing](http://processing.org) sketch and _tag_ the next person who is suppose to make an alteration.

That person will then have 24 hours to make any alteration to the code they want, even if it's simply a variable change, and do a pull-request. In their pull-request, they will need to tag the next person who has forked the repo (no tag backs) and so on.

## How you can participate
First thing to do is fork this repo. After that, it's just a matter of waiting for your name to show up in a commit. When that occurs, do a remote-pull to make sure your code is fully up to date. Then make your change, commit and do a pull-request within 24 hours and your code will be brought in.

If you're new to working with forks, check out [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for help.

And if you're completely new to git, then go through [this tutorial](http://try.github.io/) in its entirety.

And if you're new to processing, check out [this site](http://www.introprocessing.blogspot.com/).

### What you need
Make sure you have the [latest build of processing](http://processing.org/download/).
